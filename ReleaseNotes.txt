Q3 2021

- There have been some minor changes in the databases. THerefore some older artifacts might be deleted. Especially RFS relationships
- The CONFIG attribute of RFSs must be renamed to OSM_CONFIG. OSM_CONFIG includes now the json configuration to pass to OSM when creating NSDs
- Edit your docker-compose.yaml and add oasapi section. Edit the oasapi section according to your needs (db password, keycloak etc)
- Edit your /openslice/io.openslice.tmf.web/dist/io-openslice-portal-web/assets/config/config.prod.json with the new API endpoints. Please consult the config.prod.default.json
- Edit nginx.conf to add the new oas-api
